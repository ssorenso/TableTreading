# TableTreading
A basic set of libraries and base classes for handling multiple tables in a single csv file.

This is a direct spin-off of content owned by F5Networks as I worked on it
during the business day.  There is nothing here that is not easily re-created.

Please, no pushes will be accepted here.

Thanks,
Steven (original author)
